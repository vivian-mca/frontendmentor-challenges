## Overview

### About

A perfect project for newbies who are starting to build confidence with layouts!

Your users should be able to:

1. See hover states for interactive elements

### Screenshot

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS CUBE methodology
- CSS custom properties
- CSS logical properties
- CSS flexbox
- CSS frid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I was watching Kevin Powell from YouTube create this project in CUBE Methodology and I tried my best to recreate the project on my own.

This was another great practice for implementing CSS CUBE methodology and "The Stack" layout from [Every Layout](https://every-layout.dev/layouts/stack/).

### Continued development

Overall, I would like to improve on building apps from design files faster. I also need to practice more with responsive layouts. 

### Useful resources

- [CSS Logical Properties and Values](https://css-tricks.com/css-logical-properties-and-values/) - This is a good resource for learning about CSS Logical Properties and Values.
- [CUBE CSS documentation](https://cube.fyi/) - From the docs: "CUBE CSS is a CSS methodology that’s orientated towards simplicity, pragmatism and consistency. It’s designed to work with the medium that you’re working in—often the browser—rather than against it."
- [Every Layout](https://every-layout.dev/) - Extremely helpful resource for simplifying CSS layouts.
- [Figma](https://figma.com/) - Really helpful for extracting information about measurements
- [Modern CSS Reset](https://piccalil.li/blog/a-modern-css-reset/)
- [Perfect Pixel](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/perfectpixel-by-welldonec/dkaagdgjmgdmbnecmcefdhjekcoceebi) - Awesome Chrome extension that helps you to match the pixels of the provided design.
- [Responsively App](https://responsively.app/) - This DevTool helps in responsive web development. It allows you to see mirrored user-interactions across all devices.
